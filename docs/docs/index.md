# The Sophia Language

An Æternity BlockChain Language

The Sophia is a language in the ML family. It is strongly typed and has
restricted mutable state.

Sophia is customized for smart contracts, which can be published
to a blockchain (the Æternity BlockChain). Thus some features of conventional
languages, such as floating point arithmetic, are not present in Sophia, and
some blockchain specific primitives, constructions and types have been added.

    You can give all code examples you find in this doc a quick run in Aeternity's browser-based smart contract IDE, the [AEstudio IDE](https://studio.aepps.com/) !
