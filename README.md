# aesophia

This is the __sophia__ compiler for the æternity system which compiles contracts written in __sophia__ code to the æternity VM code.

For more information about æternity smart contracts and the sophia language see [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/contracts.md) and the [Sophia Language](https://github.com/aeternity/protocol/blob/master/contracts/sophia.md).

It is an OTP application written in Erlang and is by default included in
[æternity Epoch](https://github.com/aeternity/epoch). However, it can
also be included in other system to compile contracts coded in sophia which
can then be loaded into the æternity system.
